Archaeopteryx is a MIDI system for Ruby based on code from Topher Cyll's book "Practical Ruby
Projects."

Archaeopteryx successfully generates original drum and bass rhythms, tours the circle of fifths
and the circle of fourths, does extremely simplistic randomized pseudo-arpeggios, handles chord
progressions of the I-IV-V and V-I varieties, synchs original rhythms to MP3 playback, and crossfades
between existing MP3 tracks.

Archaeopteryx is a Ruby front-end to prosumer music software such as Propellerhead Reason and
Ableton Live. You need a MIDI consumer to get anything useful out of it.
